    Quick hummus recipe
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
    It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
    It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

        <em>Chickpeas</em>, hummus's main ingredient, give you <strong>protein</strong>, good-for-you carbs, and fiber. Like other members of the legume family, they routinely top lists of the world's healthiest foods.
        Eating more plant foods is good for you. People who make that a habit are less likely to get certain diseases. Of course, lots of things affect your health -- there's no miracle food -- but a little hummus wouldn't hurt.
        Garlic and olive oil are two of the best-known and most studied ingredients. They're both part of the famously good-for-you Mediterranean Diet. <q>These zesty seasonings give hummus its great flavor.</q>
